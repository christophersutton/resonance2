# Document Storage Integration Overview

## Overview

To store and manage artifacts, POCs, memos, and other reports, we'll introduce a document storage subsystem that integrates Amazon S3 for file storage and SQLite for metadata management. This subsystem will allow you to:
- Upload and retrieve documents efficiently
- Link documents to relevant entities (e.g., tasks, clients)
- Maintain an audit trail for document-related actions

## Architectural Components

1. **Amazon S3**: Stores the actual files (documents, PDFs, images, etc.)
2. **SQLite**: Stores metadata about each document, including links to S3 objects and associations with other entities
3. **Bun Server**: Handles API endpoints for uploading, downloading, and managing documents
4. **React Frontend**: Provides UI components for users to upload, view, and manage documents
